# Semantic Map Processing

## Overview

This repository provides tools for processing semantic maps by generating individual graphs for each scene and merging them into a comprehensive graph. The workflow involves downloading a semantic map archive, extracting its contents, generating k-means based graphs for each dataset, and finally merging all scene graphs into a single unified graph.
